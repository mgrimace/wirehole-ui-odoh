## What is this?

**WireHole (UI-ODoH)** is a fork of [WireHole](https://github.com/IAmStoxe/WireHole) and [WireHole-UI](https://github.com/10h30/wirehole-ui), modified to replace Unbound with [DNSCrypt-Proxy](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy) for encrypted DNS over HTTPS with **anonymized, oblivious DoH (ODoH)** support.

This all-in-one Docker Compose project enables users to easily deploy a self-managed, full or split-tunnel **WireGuard VPN** with:

- Ad-blocking via **Pi-hole**
- A web-based client manager via **WG-Easy** updated to v15
- **Encrypted, anonymized ODoH DNS** with DNSSEC and relay support using **DNSCrypt-Proxy**. Read more [here](https://github.com/SwaroopGiri/Pihole-with-Anonymized-ODOH/)

## Features

* All-in-one: WireGuard + Web UI + Adblock (via Pi-hole) + DNSCrypt-Proxy (ODoH)
* Easy installation, simple to use.
* List, create, edit, delete, enable & disable WireGuard clients.
* Show a client's QR code.
* Download a client's configuration file.
* Statistics for connected clients.
* Gravatar support.
* Secure and private DNS with anonymized ODoH and DNSSEC.

### Quickstart
To get started all you need to do is clone the repository, set the Pi-Hole webui password, and spin up the containers.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgrimace/wirehole-ui-odoh.git
cd wirehole-ui-odoh
nano docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up -d
```
### Full Setup

1. Install docker according to the official documentation, for example on a Raspberry Pi (debian-based): https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

2. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mgrimace/wirehole-ui-odoh.git
   cd wirehole-ui-odoh
    ```
3. **Set Pi-hole web interface password**  
    - Set a password directly in the `docker-compose.yaml`, or create a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`:
     ```ini
     PIHOLE_WEB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
     ```
4. **Review `docker-compose.yml` settings**  
    - **dnscrypt-proxy**  
      - Handles encrypted and anonymized DNS.
      - Uses a custom `dnscrypt-proxy.toml` from `./dnscrypt-proxy`.
      - Runs at `10.2.0.200:5350` on the `wirehole` network.

    - **Pi-hole**  
      - Acts as the DNS sinkhole and ad blocker.
      - Uses dnscrypt-proxy as its only upstream (`10.2.0.200#5350`).
      - Runs at `10.2.0.100` with environment variables for timezone, web UI password, and DNS config.

    - **wg-easy**  
      - Provides a simple web UI for managing WireGuard.
      - Uses Pi-hole for DNS (`10.2.0.100`) and routes through the subnet `10.2.0.0/24`.
      - Set `INSECURE: true` by default for easier setup (can be changed later).

    - **watchtower** *(optional)*  
      - Automatically updates running containers. You can remove or disable it if preferred.

    > If you want to use a different IP range or subnet, update the `networks:` section and any related environment variables accordingly.

5. **Launch the stack**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

    - **Troubleshooting Permissions**:  
      - Double check that DNScrypt proxy can read the provided .toml at `/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml` using `docker logs dnscrypt-proxy` and loook for any errors. If so, you may need to change its folder permissions, then restart the container e.g., 

      ```bash
      sudo chmod -R 644 dnscrypt-proxy
      ```

6. **Setup WG-Easy and split-tunnel**
    - Navigate to the Web UI will atn http://0.0.0.0:51821 or http://<device or server IP>:51821. 
    - Setup your admin account, and navigate to administrator>admin panel>config (see screeshot below)
    - Set 'HOST' to your Dynamic DNS (DDNS) address or your server's public address
    - Set DNS as `10.2.0.11`
    - **Recommended configuration / Split tunnel**  
      - Set Allowed IPs to `10.2.0.0/24` so only DNS/UI traffic goes via VPN; other traffic remains on client‚Äôs normal route.
      - Optionally, add an Allowed IP for your home network to access your self-hosted services on-the-go (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)

    > Note: wg-easy v15 does not use environmental variables for the config the same as previous versions; however, all default values are still provided in the docker-compose.yaml for setup reference. Do not comment those values back into your compose or you'll receive an error, they are for reference only.

</p>

7. **Setup your router**
    - Go to your router settings, note these steps depend entirely on your own router model
    - Forward port 51820 to your Wirehole's local IP address to enable Wireguard to work properly
    - Set your primary DNS in your DHCP server settings to your Wirehole's local IP. 
    > Important: Leave the secondary DNS blank, it is not a backup or fallback, it is a load balancer and *will* leak DNS/ads if enabled.

8. **Test for DNS leaks** 

    - Go to https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ and run a standard test. You may see more than one DNS server listed and as long as your ISP isn't listed, you were successful!

## Access PiHole

Navigate to your Wirehole's local IP https://<wirehole ip>/admin, or, while connected to WireGuard, navigate to http://10.2.0.100/admin 

![](https://i.imgur.com/hlHL6VA.png)

PiHole is already preset with DNSCrypt-Proxy as its custom upstream DNS provider. 

### (Optional) Setting a DNS record for pihole
> Note: if you're using a Raspberry Pi, this is already likely set as `raspberrypi.local`. Otherwise:
1. Login to pihole admin
2. Navigate to "Local Records"
3. Fill out the form like the image below
![Image](https://i.imgur.com/PM1kwcf.png)

Provided your DNS is properly configured on the device you're using, and you're connected to WireGuard, you can now navigate to http://pi.hole/admin and it should take you right to the pihole admin interface.

## Customizing DNSCrypt-Proxy

The `dnscrypt-proxy` service uses `./dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml`. It is pre-set for ODoH out-of-the-box; however, to change ODoH servers, relays, filters, options, etc.:

```bash
# Edit the file in your editor, then:
docker-compose restart dnscrypt-proxy
docker-compose logs -f dnscrypt-proxy
```

## Updating Info

Below are the instructions for updating **containers**:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull wireguard`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d wireguard`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Watchtower auto-updater 

* The compose file is already set with Watchtower for auto-updates. If you prefer, disable this. 

> **Note:** Watchtower is not endorsed as a solution for automated updates of existing Docker containers. In fact generally automated updates are discouraged. However, this is a useful tool for largely unattended systems. In this fork, both PiHole and DNSCrypt-Proxy use the `latest` tags which *may* cause breaking changes on updates, but generally do not; whereas WG-easy is preset to version `15` becasuse new versions *often* include breaking changes. LinuxServer.io highly recommends using Docker Compose.

## FAQ

### Why DNSCrypt-Proxy (ODoH) instead of Unbound?
DNSCrypt is an alternative to Unbound, and both cannot be used at the same time.

- Use **Unbound** for self-contained, local, recursive DNS resolution.
- Use **DNSCrypt** for encrypted, anonymized DNS with enhanced privacy.

Key features of **DNSCrypt**:
- **Encrypted DNS** ‚Äì Queries are encrypted to upstream resolvers.
- **Anonymized ODoH** ‚Äì Hides your IP from the resolver.
- **DNSSEC** ‚Äì Validation handled by dnscrypt-proxy.

Anonymized DNS is a lightweight privacy layer for DNS, similar in spirit to Tor or SOCKS‚Äîbut purpose-built. It hides client IPs from DNS resolvers, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.  
> Note: DNS anonymization only works with servers that support the DNSCrypt protocol. The .toml in this repo is preset for ODoH and DNSCrypt protocol.

### Does this work on a Raspberry Pi?
I use this on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2w with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64bit; Debian 12 Bookworm)

### Can I build ARM variants on x86_64?

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.

### Where can I get additional block lists?
* [The Big Blocklist Collection](https://firebog.net/)

### Commonly whitelisted domains
* [Pi-Hole Community List](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/commonly-whitelisted-domains/212)
* [anudeepND Whitelist](https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist)

## Networking Considerations

If you plan to use Wireguard both remotely and locally, say on your mobile phone, edit the config use on-demand activation with an exception for your home network.
